# Quantum-Memories-and-Repeaters-Visualised

This repository contains a collection of **Manim (Mathematical Animation Engine)** Python scripts used to visualize complex quantum optical phenomena.

These animations were developed to illustrate the physics behind **Quantum Memories** (EIT, AFC) and **Quantum Repeater protocols** for a Master's thesis presentation on Quantum Networks.

## 📦 Requirements

* **Python 3.10+**
* **Manim Community Edition**
* **NumPy**

## 🚀 Quick Start
To render a specific scene, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
manim -pql <filename.py> <SceneName>
```
This code is provided for educational and academic presentation purposes. Feel free to modify the parameters (Rabi frequencies, decay rates, colors) to fit your specific presentation theme.
